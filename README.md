TIC-TAC-TOE Game with AI using the Minimax Algorithm

This project is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game enhanced with an intelligent AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm, a popular decision-making strategy in game theory and artificial intelligence. The AI is capable of making optimal moves by recursively simulating all possible game states and choosing the path that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's chances.

Key features:

Interactive UI: User-friendly interface for playing against the computer.

Unbeatable AI: The AI evaluates each possible move using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring it never loses â€” it either wins or draws.

Zero hard-coded logic: The decision-making is purely algorithmic, showcasing the power of AI in deterministic games.

Educational Value: A great demonstration of how recursive algorithms, backtracking, and evaluation functions are used in real-world AI applications.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in understanding how artificial intelligence can be applied to classic board games, and serves as a foundational example before moving on to more complex game AIs like those in Chess or Go.
